Cycles Per Instruction - The Kernel Module Edition
--------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the most unnecessarily complicated netcat album release format yet. 

In this repository, you will be able to compile your own kernel module, create a 
`/dev/netcat` device and send its output into an audio player.

```
ogg123 - < /dev/netcat
```

This repository contains the album's track data in source files, that (for complexity's sake) came from `.ogg` files that were 
encoded from `.wav` files that were created from `.mp3` files that were encoded from the mastered 
`.wav` files which were generated from ProTools final mix `.wav` files that were created from 
24-track analog tape.

If complexity isn't your thing, you can go to our [webpage](http://netcat.co) and follow the links to a digital download or a cassette tape of our album.

Building
--------
We've only tested this on Ubuntu Linux. Sure, it's real easy to grab another operating system ISO 
and test it out, but after a day toiling in the bitmines, who has the energy?

First, install some dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential vorbis-tools linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

Check out the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/usrbinnc/netcat-cpi-kernel-module.git
cd netcat-cpi-kernel-module
```

Next, build the module by running:

```
make
```

Building will take a long time.  Hang with it.  Building also requires several gigabytes of memory.  We're not totally sure why, but we think it is because because the compiler is making lots of copies of several large, static arrays that contain track data.

Listening
---------

After you build, run you need to load the module and see if it is working, so you can run:

```
sudo insmod netcat.ko
dmesg
```

You should see output like the following from `dmesg`:

```
[ 2606.528153] [netcat]: netcat - Cycles Per Instruction - Kernel Module Edition - 2014
[ 2606.528153] [netcat]: netcat is Brandon Lucia, Andrew Olmstead, and David Balatero
[ 2606.528153] [netcat]: Run 'sudo mknod /dev/netcat c 250 0' to setup the device.
[ 2606.528153] [netcat]: 'ogg123 - </dev/netcat' to play.
```

Your `mknod` command will be slightly different, as the OS will assign you a different number every time. Run this command:

```
mknod /dev/netcat c <your number> 0
```

Finally, put on some headphones, and run:

```
/ogg123 - < dev/netcat
```

Track information will show up in the output of `dmesg`:

```
[  612.411529] [netcat]: Now playing track 2 - The Internet is an Apt Motherfucker
```

If you've read this far, god help us all.
